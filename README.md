## Real life use case for application
I would find myself scrolling instragram and seeing places/attractions I wanted to see so I would take a screenshot with the name/location to remind me later. With this app I don't need to take up space with photos by just sending up the information I needed to google. Good for any note you take a photo of.

## Share extension
User Defaults for sharing data between share extension and app (google token, file to send to)
